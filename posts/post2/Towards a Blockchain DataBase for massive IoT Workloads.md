# Towards a Blockchain DataBase for massive IoT Workloads

## Introduction
In recent years there has been considerable interest in IoT technologies. Namely, researchers and governments realized their potential use in Smart Cities, and therefore we are about to join a new digital era. Though, the increasing usage of IoT devices unlocks a broad spectrum of challenges. The emerging and promising technology of blockchain introduces new tools that might address some of these challenges. 

During the last year, 2019 - 2020, I was given the opportunity to be part of the [DMSL](https://dmsl.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) team developing a pioneering Blockchain project that aims to train and distribute Machine Learning Models on a private decentralized network. The whole team carried out extensive research on Blockchain and Machine Learning technologies and proposed a *Blockchain Database for massive IoT Workload*. 

## Our Goal
Our ultimate goal is to provide a **modular architecture** that enables us to **train** IoT Models on the Edge (based on real-time generated data), **distribute** them on a Blockchain Network, and finally **retrieve** them and execute probabilistic queries rapidly. The purpose of this approach is to reduce our needs in terms of storage space. One of the most significant challenges in the IoT world is the storage of rapidly and continuously generated time-series data. In our approach, we use Machine Learning techniques to abstract information into Models. Afterward, we distribute these models on a decentralized Blockchain Network. Whenever we need to perform a query, we retrieve the relevant model (according to time and location) and subsequently let the model predict (accuracy %) an answer for our query.

The diagram below illustrates the query process in more detail (Diagram creator [Stavroulla Koumou](https://github.com/skoumo01/))
